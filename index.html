        <span><h3>This page has a lot of things on it that are broken. Here is a list of things that need fixed:</h3>

          <ol>
            <li>You should be able to scroll down the main content (all of the cards here in the grey section) but instead the page scrolls and the footer overlaps the main content.
              Fix it so that the cards will be contained in the main content and scroll correctly if they take up more room than the main content height.
            </li>
            <li>
              You'll notice that the image in this card doesn't load. Fix it so that the image will display.
            </li>
            <li>
              Fix the header so that it extends all the way to the edge of the screen
            </li>
            <li>
              Fix the first link in the sidenav so that it wraps instead of going outside of the sidenav
            </li>
            <li>
              Fix the "about" link in the sidenav so that it takes you to the about page
            </li>
          </ol>
